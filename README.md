## üíª System Requirements

This project assumes that you have the following installed globally:

- [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage your Node environment.

You'll also need a way to run a LAMP/LEMP (Linux, Apache/nginx, MySQL, PHP) stack on your machine. This Starter Kit comes configured to run with [Ups Dock](https://github.com/upstatement/ups-dock), an nginx proxy and DNS server to allow you to access your site via a custom named host. To install it follow these steps:

> **WARNING:** Ups Dock requires Mac OS Sierra 10.12 or above. If you want to install without Ups Dock, skip these steps.

1. Install [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac): >= version 4

2. Install [Ups Dock](https://github.com/upstatement/ups-dock) by following the installation steps in the [README](https://github.com/upstatement/ups-dock#installation)

## üõ† Installation

1.  Run `nvm install` to ensure you're using the correct version of Node.

2.  Duplicate the contents of `.env.sample` into a new `.env` file.

    - For a **standard single site WordPress instance running in Ups Dock**, the `COMPOSE_FILE` line of your `.env` should be set to:

      ```shell
      COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.ups-dock.yml
      ```

    - If you **do not want to use Ups Dock**, change the `COMPOSE_FILE` line in your `.env` to be:

      ```shell
      COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml
      ```

      > [!NOTE]
      > To build out a **multisite instance of WordPress**, Change the `COMPOSE_FILE` line in your `.env` file to be:
      >
      > ```shell
      > COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.ups-dock-multisite.yml
      > ```
      >
      > In addition to updating the environment variable above, the SSL certificates generated by [Ups Dock](https://github.com/Upstatement/ups-dock) will need to be updated to include your four level subdomains. To do this:
      >
      > a. Navigate to your local copy of [Ups Dock](https://github.com/Upstatement/ups-dock)
      >
      > ```shell
      > cd path/to/ups-dock
      > ```
      >
      > b. Add your wildcard domain to the `[ alternate_names ]` section in `config/openssl.conf`
      >
      > ```text
      > DNS.1 = ups.dock
      > DNS.2 = *.ups.dock
      > DNS.3 = *.the-equity-fund.ups.dock
      > ```
      >
      > c. Regenerate certs and restart Ups Dock
      >
      > ```shell
      > ./bin/gen-certs.sh
      > docker compose up -d
      > ```

3.  Duplicate the `auth.json.sample` file and rename it to `auth.json`. Find `The Equity Fund auth.json` on 1PW and copy its contents into this file.

4.  If you're using the Starter Kit as a template for another project, you will want run the rename theme command and follow the prompt, which will set up the project with your desired theme name and metadata:

    ```shell
    ./bin/rename
    ```

    If you are looking to contribute to the Starter Kit project, see [üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Contributing](#-contributing).

5.  In `package.json` and `composer.json`, update repository and author information as needed

6.  Run the install command

    ```shell
    ./bin/install
    ```

7.  Once the installation script has finished, run the start command

    ```shell
    ./bin/start
    ```

8.  In another terminal tab, run the setup theme command, which will activate your theme and update the seed database

    ```shell
    ./bin/setup-theme
    ```

9.  The site should be up and running with BrowserSync at <http://localhost:3000>, which proxies <https://the-equity-fund.ups.dock> if you're using Ups Dock, or <http://localhost:8888> if you're not.

10. To access WP admin, visit `/wp-admin`. The default credentials are `admin` / `password` (configurable via `docker-compose.yml`) You may need to click on an 'Update Database' button the first time you log in, defaults are fine here.

To shut down the container and development server, type `Ctrl+C`.

**(Optional)** If you're running an Ups Dock build and you want to re-export the seed database without Ups Dock URLs, run the following command:

```shell
./bin/db-to-no-upsdock
```

## Activating Plugins

Plugins are managed with Composer. See the [Wiki entry on plugins](https://github.com/Upstatement/wordpress-starter-kit/wiki/Plugins) for more information on commonly used plugins, including the Upstatement Editorial plugin and ACF.

## Debugging

- Follow this guide to debug Timber templates: <https://timber.github.io/docs/guides/debugging/#enable-debugging>

### Twig Functions

In twig files, there are two common function you can use to print variables to the page: `dump()` and `print_r`.

```html
<pre>
  {{ dump(your_variable) }}
</pre>

{{ your_variable | print_r }}
```

### Error Logs

The gitignored `logs/error.log` file is a good place to look when hitting ‚Äúcritical error‚Äù screens during development. You can print to them using the `error_log` function, and can track updates to them in realtime using the following command:

```shell
./bin/logs
```

### Debug Bar & Timber Debug Bar Plugins

For more in-depth information like showing query, cache, and other helpful debugging information, you can install and enable the [Debug Bar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/debug-bar/) and [Timber Debug Bar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/debug-bar-timber/) plugins.

## Common `wp-cli` commands

The docker containers come configured with [WP CLI](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/cli/); you can access WP CLI on the docker container while it is running with the [`wp` script](/blob/main/bin/wp).

Start the Docker containers with `./bin/start` and then run any of the following commands in a separate shell:

```shell
./bin/wp [command]
```

To update the local WordPress version:

```shell
./bin/wp core update
```

To export the database:

```shell
./bin/wp db export - > docker/conf/mysql/init-ups-dock.sql
```

To export the database and gzip it:

```shell
./bin/wp db export - | gzip -3 > docker/conf/mysql/init-ups-dock.sql.gz
```

To SSH into the WordPress container:

```shell
docker compose exec wordpress /bin/bash
```

## üöÄ Deployment

When creating a deployment, we recommend generating a new release for your project with an appropriate version bump to the theme's version. This will help facilitate cache-busting for static assets, which receive the theme's version as a query string appended to the end of the path.

You can use the following script to bump the version numbers in this project's `package.json` and the theme's `style.css` (which is where the theme pulls the canonical version from):

```sh
./bin/versionbump [<newversionnumber> | major | minor | patch | premajor | preminor | prepatch | prerelease]
```

By default, running the script with no arguments will result in a patch version bump (so, from `1.0.1` to `1.0.2`). The script utilizes [`npm-version`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-version) behind the scenes to define the new version number; see [those docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-version) for more information on the available version options.

Manually run the deployment script:

```
./bin/deploy [SFTP_HOST] [SFTP_USER] [SFTP_PORT]
```

## üîÑ Object-Oriented Approach

This theme utilizes an simple but structured object-oriented approach.

## üì∞ Gutenberg

This theme has built-in support for building custom blocks. The wiki article on [Building Blocks](https://github.com/Upstatement/wordpress-starter-kit/wiki/Building-Blocks) in the Starter Kit repo has more documentation around the different methods for creating blocks and how to build them.

## ‚ôø Accessibility Testing

[Pa11y](https://pa11y.org/) is an automated tool that audits our website's pages for accessibility issues according to [WCAG 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) standards. This tool captures machine detectable errors such as missing alt text, wrong heading order, browser errors, etc. For issues such as color contrast, keyboard navigation, or VoiceOver functionality, manual testing is advised.

To run the tests, run the following command:

```sh
npm run test:a11y <url>
```

where `<url>` is a valid URL, or one of `local`, `staging` or `live`. Running the command without specifying the url will default to `local`.

### Configuring pa11y

The `package.json` file has preset configurations for pa11y under `testing.accessibility`.

- `paths` (array): Paths appended to the specified URL.
- `ignore.codes` (array): WCAG codes to ignore
- `ignore.selectors` (array): CSS selectors to ignore

## üåê Configuring Multisite

In our Starter Kit, multisite is configured to run in subdomain mode:

```text
site-1.the-equity-fund.ups.dock
site-2.the-equity-fund.ups.dock
```

If you would like to run multisite in subdirectory mode

```text
the-equity-fund.ups.dock/site-1
the-equity-fund.ups.dock/site-2
```

Make the following changes:

1. Set the following environment variable in `docker-compose.ups-dock-multisite.yml` to 0, or just remove the line entirely.

   ```yaml
   WORDPRESS_MULTISITE_SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL: 0
   ```

2. Update your `VIRTUAL_HOST` environment variable in `docker-compose.ups-dock-multisite.yml` as follows or just remove the line entirely.

   ```yaml
   VIRTUAL_HOST: the-equity-fund.ups.dock,*.the-equity-fund.ups.dock
   ```

3. Update the SSL certificates generated by Ups Dock to include your four level subdomains

   a. Navigate to your local copy of [Ups Dock](https://github.com/Upstatement/ups-dock)

   ```shell
   cd path/to/ups-dock
   ```

   b. Remove the wildcard domain from the `[ alternate_names ]` section in `config/openssl.conf` (if it was channged) as follows:

   ```text
   DNS.1 = ups.dock
   DNS.2 = *.ups.dock
   ```

   c. Regenerate certs and restart Ups Dock

   ```shell
   ./bin/gen-certs.sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```

### Caveats

- Subdomain installs won't work without Ups Dock (or another tool that allows you to map domains to Docker containers) as it will not work when your base domain is `localhost`

For more details about everything these config vars do under the surface, consult [MULTISITE.md](MULTISITE.md).
